# Twitch Popular Streamers

I decided to put my newly acquired data analytics skills to the test by analyzing an idea I had as a gamer and a viewer of twitch streams. Specifically, I wanted to identify patterns among the streams that successfully attract a large number of viewers and maintain high engagement.

Some of the key questions I aimed to answer included:
* Are the most streamed games the best ones by views count?
* Does the language of the stream affect the number of views and followers ?
* Does the Stream duration affect the number of views and followers ?
* What is the best days for gaining followers and viewers?

For more detailed information, please refer to the Jupyter Notebook for this analysis.
